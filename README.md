# laravel-engine

![Tests](https://github.com/paulhenri-l/laravel-engine/workflows/Tests/badge.svg)

A Laravel package to help you create Laravel packages.

Laravel engine goal is to provide you with the tools to efficiently and easily
hook your packages into a Laravel Application.

No more tinkering around to edit the application scheduler. No more searching
through stack overflow to register middlewares, routes, listeners, commands,
config from your package. All of that with unit testing is baked in!

Everything you may want will be one function call away letting you focus on your
package's code instead of the framework internals.
